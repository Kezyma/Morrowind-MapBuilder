Instructions
	This tool can be used to generate a complete set of map tiles and a viewer for Morrowind, to generate a map for your specific mod list, please follow the instructions.

	A map of the vanilla game generated using this tool is available here for comparison: https://kezyma.github.io/map/morrowind/map.html

	If you have issues running the tool, please try installing .Net 8.0 Runtime: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

1) Generating Map Tiles
	Before using this tool, you first have to generate local map tiles from Morrowind using the CreateMaps console command, there are a few steps involved in setting up, but they don't take too long. The actual generating of tiles can take quite a while depending on hardware and mods, however.

	Apply Morrowind Code Patch 
	- ﻿Contains a fix that prevents the CreateMaps command from loading interior cells.

	Remove MGE XE from the game folder entirely. 
	- MGE XE disables Morrowind's vanilla pixel shader, which causes rendering issues with water. If there is an error on launch that it's missing, you left some files behind. You can move MGE XE back to the game folder after maps are generated.

	(Optional) Disable mods that won't alter the world map. 
	- Only include new worldspaces, landscape & architecture edits, and texture & mesh changes. This is only helpful to improve performance and reduce the chance of a crash. For many mod lists, this may not be needed.

	Update Morrowind.ini to set Create Maps Enable=2
	- This enables the CreateMaps console command and sets it to generate them as images. Morrowind.ini is located in the Morrowind folder, or by using the Ini Editor tool in Mod Organizer.

	Create a Maps folder inside Morrowind 
	- Morrowind won't create the folder, so if it doesn't exist, maps won't be saved.

	Enable Pixel Shader in Morrowind Launcher 
	- This is required to render water correctly on the maps. Run MorrowindLauncher.exe and set it in Options.

	(Optional) Set Morrowind to 640x480 resolution and switch to Window mode. 
	- This improves the speed at which maps are generated and allows you to use the machine while maps are generated.

	Launch Morrowind and start a New Game. 
	- Scripts don't start running immediately, so it's faster to do this with a new game.

	Open the console with ` after the cutscene but before the prompt to enter your name. 
	- This isn't too important, you can also open the console after entering your name, but some scripts will have started.

	Run the command CreateMaps "Morrowind.esm"
	- Your character will now teleport to every exterior cell in the game and generate a map image for it. This can take some time, depending on mods and hardware. Crashes are (usually) caused by a mod conflict causing a particular cell to crash while loading.

	Exit the game when new cells stop loading 
	- The map tiles are stored in the Maps folder created earlier.


2) Using Map Builder
	Once you have map tiles generated, you can use MapGenerator to build the layers of the map and generate a sample page with the map to explore.

	Run MapGenerator.exe
	- If using Mod Organizer, run MapGenerator.exe through Mod Organiser to ensure the correct mods are detected.

	Select the path to your Morrowind folder and the path to where you would like the map to be generated.
	- If you have moved the Maps folder out of Morrowind, you need to select that as well.

	(Optional) Check the box to generate a full-size PNG of the entire map
	- This can fail if the map is too large, but it won't affect the HTML map if that happens. 

	(Optional) Check the box to export map coordinates from your mod list
	- In-game map markers will be extracted and available on the generated map. Requires an internet connection to download tes3conv.

	Click on 'Generate Map' and wait for it to complete.
	- This can take some time, especially with large modlists or large maps.

	Open map.html in the output folder you specified to browse the map.


	You can also run the generator app from the command line with Morrowind and output paths as the first two paramaters:
	MapGenerator.exe "path/to/Morrowind" "path/to/output"

	If your Maps path is different, add it as the third paramater:
	MapGenerator.exe "path/to/Morrowind" "path/to/output" "path/to/maps"

	You can add extra paramaters at the end to generate the full size PNG map or generate map markers:
	MapGenerator.exe "path/to/Morrowind" "path/to/output" bigmap markers


Generated Files
	A selection of files are generated by MapGenerator.exe
	A set of numbered folders containing each layer of the map. The folder with the highest number contains the original tiles generated by CreateMaps, while the other contains tiles generated for different levels of zooming out.
	map.html, contains a demo of the map using leaflet.js.
	map.png, if you choose to generate the full-size PNG map, this will be it.
